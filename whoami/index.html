While I enjoy it, I also like tinkering with servers and backend development.</p><p>At times, these interests overlap in my work, which I find especially satisfying. On the other hand, frontend web development is something I still struggle with - it’s on my list to revisit someday.</p><hr><p>I started my career as an intern at FXMedia Internet, a Singapore-based company. Due to COVID, I was able to work remotely throughout my 3 years there. After my internship, I was offered a full-time position and later promoted to senior.</p><p>I mostly worked on VR and mobile AR applications for FXMedia’s clients, sometimes involving multiplayer. During the peak of the metaverse trend, FXMedia attempted to pivot into developing one, where I became the main contributor to their internal module. In my final 6 months there, I explored Unreal Engine, MetaHuman, and chatbot integrations. I also improved their workflows by introducing version control (git) and a basic CI/CD pipeline.</p><hr><p>After that, I joined Brandoville Studios, an art outsourcing company based in Jakarta with AA and AAA game studio clients. I was initially hired to develop games for some of their IPs, but plans shifted and I was assigned to prototype various drafts instead.</p><p>During this period, I worked across multiple areas: editor customization, tools development, multiplayer, GAS, backend development for their internal shopping app (with a streamlined CI/CD pipeline), as well as building a custom matchmaking service and a launcher tool for 3D artists and animators. Unfortunately, the company eventually shut down due to internal conflicts. (You can easily find out more online - it’s quite unpleasant and inhumane in my opinion.)</p><hr><p>Now I’m happily working at Stairway Games, based in Denpasar (though most of us work remotely). I’m currently contributing to the major 1.2b update (and beyond) for <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral_Island/>Coral Island</a> (please wishlist if you haven’t already - buying the game also helps support us!)</p><p>Here, I’ve focused heavily on multiplayer gameplay: resolving critical gameplay bugs (both single-player and multiplayer), implementing new multiplayer features, and optimizing network replication using techniques such as ReplicationGraph, push-model networking, and custom net serialization to support fast array and atomic replication.</p><p>I’ve also gained console development experience, contributing to successful console certifications by ensuring gameplay systems meet PlayStation and Xbox submission requirements. I worked on integrating multiple platforms to support crossplay across Steam, PS5, WinGDK (Microsoft Store), and Xbox Series S/X via Epic Online Services.</p></details></div></article></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js></script><script src=/js/lastfm.js></script></html>
