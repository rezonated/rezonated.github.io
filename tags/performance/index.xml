 Introduction
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The mesmerizing dance of a starling murmuration or the synchronized ballet of a fish school seems guided by a single, intelligent mind. Yet, this complex, life-like motion isn&amp;rsquo;t orchestrated by a leader; it&amp;rsquo;s an emergent phenomenon. This is what the Boids algorithm, created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, so elegantly captures: the idea that sophisticated group behavior can arise from individuals following a few simple rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This principle offers a fascinating way to add life to game worlds. A common application is simulating a school of fish, but a significant technical challenge arises when scaling up to large numbers. The target here was to effectively simulate a school of 1000 fish, moving as one cohesive unit while still allowing for individual interaction.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
