 Introduction

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Simulating the flocking behavior of birds or the schooling of fish is a classic problem in computer graphics. The Boids algorithm, created by &lt;a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig Reynolds&lt;/a> in 1986, offers a powerful solution. It demonstrates how complex, life-like group motion can emerge from individuals following a few simple rules, without any central leader or complex choreography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This principle offers a way to add life to game worlds. A common application is simulating a school of fish, but a significant technical challenge arises when scaling up to large numbers. The target here was to effectively simulate a school of 1000 fish, moving as one cohesive unit while still allowing for individual interaction.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
