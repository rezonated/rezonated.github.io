Hi again, my name is Vanan Andreas, although my full name is actually a _lot_ longer than that ({{< spoiler >}} Andreas E*vanan*da Gusti Purwanto {{< /spoiler >}}) - an Indonesian programmer specializing in game development using major game engines (Unreal Engine, Unity).

Feel free to scroll through to know me a bit more!

{{< dropdown title="Mechanical Keyboards" >}}

Outside of work, I’m quite into custom mechanical keyboards. I’ve fallen into the rabbit hole ever since COVID started.

Although I’ve sold most of my collection, here’s what I still have:
- Eyelash Corne w/ ZMK (weird ergo layout FTW!)
- HHKB Pro 2 w/ JayKeeb custom controller
- IBM Model M SSK
- Quefrency
- Cenderawasih Alice
- UTD 356mini
- Scuffed hex.3c R1
- Cherry G80
- RARTAND w/ custom wooden case

Favorite MX switches: JWICK Black, BCP, Gateron Ink Black  
Topre and Buckling Springs are also favorites.  
I haven’t tried custom domes from Deskeys or BKE yet.  
I also haven’t had a chance to try Alps switches - finding boards to harvest is difficult where I live.

{{< dropdown title="Personal career journey" >}}

I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Kalbis Institute in 2021 and chose to focus on game development. While I enjoy it, I also like tinkering with servers and backend development.

At times, these interests overlap in my work, which I find especially satisfying. On the other hand, frontend web development is something I still struggle with - it’s on my list to revisit someday.

---

I started my career as an intern at FXMedia Internet, a Singapore-based company. Due to COVID, I was able to work remotely throughout my 3 years there. After my internship, I was offered a full-time position and later promoted to senior.

I mostly worked on VR and mobile AR applications for FXMedia’s clients, sometimes involving multiplayer. During the peak of the metaverse trend, FXMedia attempted to pivot into developing one, where I became the main contributor to their internal module. In my final 6 months there, I explored Unreal Engine, MetaHuman, and chatbot integrations. I also improved their workflows by introducing version control (git) and a basic CI/CD pipeline.

---

After that, I joined Brandoville Studios, an art outsourcing company based in Jakarta with AA and AAA game studio clients. I was initially hired to develop games for some of their IPs, but plans shifted and I was assigned to prototype various drafts instead.

During this period, I worked across multiple areas: editor customization, tools development, multiplayer, GAS, backend development for their internal shopping app (with a streamlined CI/CD pipeline), as well as building a custom matchmaking service and a launcher tool for 3D artists and animators. Unfortunately, the company eventually shut down due to internal conflicts. (You can easily find out more online - it’s quite unpleasant and inhumane in my opinion.)

---

Now I’m happily working at Stairway Games, based in Denpasar (though most of us work remotely). I’m currently contributing to the major 1.2 update (and beyond) for [Coral Island](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral_Island/) (please wishlist if you haven’t already - buying the game also helps support us!)

Here, I’ve focused heavily on multiplayer gameplay: resolving critical gameplay bugs (both single-player and multiplayer), implementing new multiplayer features, and optimizing network replication using techniques such as ReplicationGraph, push-model networking, and custom net serialization to support fast array and atomic replication.

I’ve also gained console development experience, contributing to successful console certifications by ensuring gameplay systems meet PlayStation and Xbox submission requirements. I worked on integrating multiple platforms to support crossplay across Steam, PS5, WinGDK (Microsoft Store), and Xbox Series S/X via Epic Online Services.
